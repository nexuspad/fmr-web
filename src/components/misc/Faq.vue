<h2>Are you an agency?</h2>

  All we do is providing a user-friendly, 100% free real estate listing platform for home sellers, real estate agents, 
  private landlords, commercial property managers to market their properties online and for house hunters and renters

<h2>Do I need to create an account?</h2>
<p>Yes. A valid account is required.</p>

<h2>What kind of personal information do you store?</h2>
<p>Your email address only for login purpose.<br/>
We do not share your email with any third party.</p>

<h2 id="Verification">Why do you need SMS(text) verification?</h2>
<p>Mobile text verification provides a stronger level of security and can effectively reduce spam/scam on our site
  by filtering out certain users who intend to use the site inappropriately.<br/>
Your phone number is only used once for sending a verification code and we do not store your phone number in our system.</p>

<h2>I don't have a mobile phone / I don't want to give out my number / Texting does not work, what do I do?</h2>

  During that period of time, you can remove your ad earlier if your property has been taken/sold. 
  You will be able to extend your ad one week before the expiration date. </p>

<h2>How can I manage my ads?</h2>
<p>You can log in to your account and update, de-activate(activate), or extend your ad.</p>
