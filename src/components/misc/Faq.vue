We will not send you unsolicited text message or share your phone number with any third party.</p>

<h2>I don't have a mobile phone / I don't want to give out my number / Texting does not work, what do I do?</h2>
<p>You can email us at help@findmyroof.com. We'll be happy to manually verify your account and activate it for you.</p>

<h2>How long will my ad stay "live" on FindMyRoof.com?</h2>
<p>Technically your ad will stay "live" for a period of 60 days once it is posted on FindMyRoof.com. During that period, you can remove your ad earlier if your property has been taken/sold. You will be able to extend your ad one week before the expiration date. An email reminder will be sent to you then.</p>
